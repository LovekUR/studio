## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: A smooth gradient blending violet (#E6E6FA), pink (#FFB6C1), and nude (#F5DEB3) to create a calming and friendly atmosphere.
- Primary color: Violet (#9400D3), a slightly brighter color which still falls inside our background blend. Meant for UI elements like buttons, navigational elements and form fields
- Accent color: A soft pink (#FF69B4) to highlight interactive elements.
- Body font: 'PT Sans', sans-serif. Use for the body of text. Font is chosen as a contrast against the possible vibrancy and bold elements of the website to create balance.
- Headline font: 'Playfair', serif. Used to make headings that stand out on the screen and contrast nicely against body text. Should never be used for small blocks of text.
- Use simple, friendly icons that visually represent each feature and promote ease of understanding.
- Maintain a clean, responsive design with clear sections for each feature, ensuring the site is accessible and mobile-friendly.
- Implement gently floating shapes in the background to add a dynamic, engaging effect. Feature cards can have subtle hover effects.
